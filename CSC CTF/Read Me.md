## Crypto Challenge - Decipher
ChatGPT 
Prompt - Welcome to the qualification round of the Cyber Security Challenge. Jump into the zigzag journey by cracking the following cipher: WSeCClo2cT0oe2m2. What is the flag. and explain how you got to it.
Response
WSeCClo2cT0oe2m2

If we break it apart by numbers, we get:

- WSeCClo2
- cT0
- oe2
- m2

Let's focus on the "zigzag" hint. If we arrange the characters in a zigzag pattern based on the numbers, it might give us a hint:
```
WSeCClo2 
	cT0 
		oe2 
			m2
```
Reading vertically, we get: "Welcome to C2SC2022."
So, the flag might be: **C2SC2022** or **Welcome to C2SC2022**.
This line of thinking was wrong but it helped me spot the answer nonetheless.
Flag - WelcomeToCSC2022
